# kruskal-clustering
Clustering Algorithm based on Kruska's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

## Introduction
Clustering is a fundamental problem in data mining. The goal is to partition
a given set of objects into subsets (or clusters) in such a way that any two
objects from the same subset are close (or similar) to each other, while any
two objects from diﬀerent subsets are far apart.

## Problem Description
### Task. 
Given _n_ points on a plane and an integer _K_, compute the largest possible value of _d_ such that the
given points can be partitioned into _k_ non-empty subsets in such a way that the distance between any
two points from diﬀerent subsets is at least _d_.

### Input Format. 
The frst line contains the number _n_ of points. Each of the following _n_ lines defnes a point
(_x(i)_, _y(i)_). The last line contains the number _k_ of clusters.
